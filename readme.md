### Javascript Calculator

Build a JS Calculator

## Prerequisites

-   Javascript

## Instructions

1.  Create your own fork of this [repl.it](https://repl.it/@marcwright/JS-Calculator-HW)

You are required to turn in your submission by creatin an issue on this repository.

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar or by an instructor, homework is due the next morning by 8:00am.

## Requirements

Your task is to create a Javascript object that represents a calculator. It should have methods that provide it with the following functionality...

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponents (Hint: Look up Javascript's Math object)
- An operation of your choice!

You should be able to run these methods like so from your browser's Javascript console...

```js
calculator.add(1,2);
// => 3
```

## Bonus 1
Give your calculator memory and allow it to persist the result of multiple operations.
* Store this result in a `value` property.
* Give your calculator a `clear` method that resets `value`.

For example:

```js
calculator.add(1)
// value is 1
calculator.add(2)
// value is 3
calculator.add(2)
// value is 5
calculator.multiply(2)
// value is 10
```
## Bonus 2

Give your calculator a "master" method that can parse through a string of operations (e.g., `(2 - 1) * (5 ^ 2)`)
* Your calculator should still have memory.
